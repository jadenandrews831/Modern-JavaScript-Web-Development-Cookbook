To determine 'this' from a function calls call=site, ask these questions in this order, and stop when the first
rule applies.

  1) Is the function called with 'new' (new binding)? If so, 'this' is the newly constructed object.

      var bar = new foo()

  2) Is the function called with 'call' or 'apply' (explicit binding), even hidden inside a 'bind' hard
     binding? If so, 'this' is the explicitly specified object.

      var bar = foo.call( obj2 )

  3) If the function called with a context (implicit binding), otherwise known as an owning or containing 
     object? If so, 'this' is that context object.

      var bar = obj.foo();

  4) Otherwise, default the 'this' (default binding). If in 'strict mode', pick undefined, otherise pick 
     pick the global object.

      var bar = foo()
