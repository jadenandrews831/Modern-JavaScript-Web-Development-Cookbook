Array

The JavaScript 'Array' class is a global object that is used in the construction of arrays; which are high-level, 
list-like objects.

Description

Arrays are list-like objects whose prototype has methods to perform traversal and mutation operations. Neither the length
of a JavaScript array not the types of its elements are fixed. Sinec an array's length can change at any time, and data 
can be stored at non-contiguous locations in the array, JavaScript arrays are not guaranteed to be dense; this depends on
how the programmer chooses to use them. In general, these are convenient characteristics; but if these features are not 
desireable for your particular use, you might consider using typed arrays.

Arrays cannot use strings as element indexes (as in an associative array/dictionary) but must use integers. Setting or
accessing via non-integers using bracket notation (or dot notation) will not set or retrieve an element from an array list
itself, but will set or access a variable associated with that array's object property collection. The array's object 
properties and list of array elements are separate, and the arary's traversal and mutation operations canno be applied to
these named properties.
